# Introduction

The Nest Boilerplates project is an open-source initiative to provide pre-configured boilerplates for developers building applications on the Nest framework. We understand the time-consuming process of starting a project from scratch and setting up all the necessary components. This project aims to improve your development experience by offering boilerplates for various scenarios. 

Each folder in this repository represents a different boilerplate project that focuses on a particular usage or integration, such as Mongoose, Sequelize, GraphQL, caching, authentication, and more. With detailed explanations and step-by-step guides, you can get started with your preferred boilerplate in just a matter of minutes!

To further simplify the process, we also have plans to release a CLI tool that allows you to create a project based on any of these boilerplates with a simple command.
 
We welcome you to be a part of this exciting journey to enhance the Nest ecosystem and create a better development experience for everyone.

## Coming Soon: Nest Boilerplate CLI!!

> [!NOTE]
> Future Feature: CLI for creating NestJS projects based on boilerplates.

We are excited to announce that in the near future, we will be introducing a command-line interface (CLI) for the Nest Boilerplates project. This CLI will make it even easier to create NestJS projects based on any of our available boilerplates.

No more hassle or manual setup! With just a simple command, you will be able to create a fully functional NestJS project using your desired boilerplate.

Here's a sneak peek of how it will work:

1. Install the Nest Boilerplate CLI globally on your machine.

```
npm install -g nest-boilerplate-cli
```

2. Choose your desired boilerplate from our collection. For example, let's say you want to create a project using the "mongoose" boilerplate.

3. Run the CLI command, specifying the boilerplate you wish to use.

```
nest-boilerplate-cli create --boilerplate=mongoose
```

4. Sit back and relax while the Nest Boilerplate CLI takes care of the heavy lifting, creating your project based on the selected boilerplate.

Once the process is complete, you will have a fully configured NestJS project, ready to be customized
